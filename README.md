# Color-Based Object Recognition
•	Objective: Recognize and segment objects based on their color.
•	Techniques: Color space conversion (e.g., RGB to HSV), thresholding, morphological operations.
•	Steps:
1.	Convert images to a suitable color space (e.g., HSV).
2.	Apply color thresholding to segment objects.
3.	Use morphological operations to refine the segmentation.
4.	Display and label the segmented objects.
